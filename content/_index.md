I am a **PhD student** at [Department of Electronic Systems](https://es.aau.dk), [Aalborg University](https://aau.dk) (AAU) working on **security aspects of machine learning, and applied cases of machine learning in adversarial settings**.

After obtaining a M.Sc. in Machine Intelligence ([thesis](/files/msc_thesis.pdf)) and B.Sc. in Software Engineering from AAU, I went onto become a data scientist and utilize machine learning for a variety of business applications.
These applications spanned across multiple fields, such as: medical ([Enversion](https://enversion.dk)), insurance ([Ecsact](https://ecsact.dk), [Tryg Insurance](https://tryg.com)) and logistics ([Ecsact](https://ecsact.dk)).

The research conducted throughout my PhD is set out to **improve the robustness of phishing detection models** by a set of empirical studies, that leads to more fundamental research that address the underlying methodologies and theories.
