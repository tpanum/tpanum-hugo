My name is **Thomas Kobber Panum**, and I am currently employed as a Ph.D. Student at Deparment of Electronic Systems, [Aalborg University (AAU)](https://aau.dk).
Historically speaking, I obtained my M.Sc. Software Engineering with a specialization in Machine Intelligence ([thesis](http://bit.ly/1O7nEWX)) in from [AAU](https://aau.dk) in 2014.
Before  I came back to academia in December 2017, I worked in industry as a **Data Scientist** across various sectors, namely: medical ([Enversion](http://www.enversion.dk/)), insurance ([Ecsact](http://ecsact.dk/), [Tryg Forsikring](https://tryg.dk/)) and logistics (part of consultancy).
This left me with over five years of hands-on experience with creating mathematical prediction models both across academia and industry.

My research primarily focuses on **improving the robustness of phishing detection models** through the use of adversarial learning.

Non-scientific interest include: classic electronic music, mountain biking, sour-dough baking, ergonomic keyboards, and customization of my linux desktop.
