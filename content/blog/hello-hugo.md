About every second year, I suddenly feel the urge to change the layout of my blog.
This usually leads to not only a visual face-lift of the blog, but also an excuse to give into new technologies that have emerged within the last years.

This year is no excuse, and I decided to dive into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a static website engine written in [Go](http://golang.org).
I have spent the last year primary programming in Go and [Python](http://python.org), and it've been an absolute joy.
Seeing Hugo being written in Go, dragged me right in (despite no Go knowlegde needed in order to use Hugo).

Hugo is primary based around three technologies: (Cross platform statically linked) Binary for processing, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for content, and [Go Templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) for layouts.
The Hugo binary will help you with initializing new projects, content creation, and (extremely fast) real-time processing of content.

As of writing Hugo is currently version 0.16, but don't let that scare you. It's already widely used, and [the project has over 10.000 stats on GitHub](https://github.com/spf13/hugo).
