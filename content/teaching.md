This section covers the teaching I have conducted during my time as a teacher and PhD at [Aalborg University (AAU)](http://aau.dk).
### Courses


**Webapplikationssikkerhed** (Security of Web Applications), IT Vest, Autumn 2018. Taught in collaboration with [René Rydhof Hansen](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~rrh/)

**Sikker software** (Secure Software), IT Vest, Autumn 2018. Taught in collaboration with [René Rydhof Hansen](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~rrh/)

**Trafikanalyse og netværkssikkerhed** (Traffic Analysis and Network Security), IT Vest, Autumn 2017. Taught in collaboration with [Jens Myrup Pedersen](http://personprofil.aau.dk/107697?lang=en#/minside) and [Kaspar Hageman](http://personprofil.aau.dk/141886?lang=en).

### Supervision
As a central piece of [AAU](http://aau.dk)'s problem-based learning model, there has been implemented semesterly projects (15 ETCS) for every semester.
Despite the smaller workload, the structure of the projects are comparable to classical theses (bachelor, master).
