_Currently employed as PhD Student at [Aalborg University](https://aau.dk), under the supervision of [Jens Myrup Pedersen](http://personprofil.aau.dk/107697?lang=en#/minside), in which the field of Automated Phishing Detection (using machine learning) is being studied._
 
I'm Thomas Kobber Panum, and I hold a M.Sc. in Software Engineering (specialization in Machine Intelligence), which lead me to spent most of my time doing Data Science for a living.
During my post-graduate studies I applied Machine Learning to the multi-classification problem of illness prediction at [Enversion](http://www.enversion.dk/), which lead to [this thesis](http://bit.ly/1O7nEWX).
