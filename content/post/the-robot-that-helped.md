Everyone knows the struggle of getting an apartment in Copenhagen.
It is a tough task, and a decent network is surely very valuable in that regard.
However, as many others, I had almost no network in Copenhagen prior to moving here for my job at [Ecsact](http://ecsact.dk/).
My journey began at [Boligportalen](https://www.boligportal.dk/), which is most used site for finding apartments for rent in Denmark.
One of the most notable features about boligportalen, is the fact that they have an absurdly expensive subscription for accessing contact for the landlords.
At the time of my apartment hunt, the price were approximately 300 DDK/month (~$50), with no guarantees or payback option.
They even had an option get a discount, if you were ready to bind your subscription for several months.
Does anyone *expect* to be seeking an apartment for several months, and then just *donate* the remaining months to boligportalen? Absurd.
